## Automatic Statistics

The sponsor page automatically calculates:

- Total number of supporters
- Total sponsored amount
- Most recent supporters (sorted by date)

These are updated in real time.

## Display Logic

- If `qrcode` is set: show QR code
- If `link` is set: show external link button
- QR code takes priority if both are set

## I18n for UI Text

You can localize UI labels via `themeConfig.langs.sponsor`:

```typescript
// .vitepress/config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  themeConfig: {
    langs: {
      sponsor: {
        selectPaymentMethod: 'Select Payment Method',
        recentSupporters: 'Recent Supporters',
        totalSupporters: 'Supporters',
        totalAmount: 'Total Amount'
      }
    }
  }
})
```
